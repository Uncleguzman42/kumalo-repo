Below is a detailed guide to building a robust portfolio as an entry-level cybersecurity analyst, tailored to attract recruiters by showcasing practical skills and clear documentation. The portfolio will include four projects, each hosted in a clean GitHub repository with comprehensive documentation, covering diverse cybersecurity domains (network security, vulnerability management, incident response, and system hardening). I’ll align the projects with common skills from entry-level job postings (e.g., SOC analyst or junior pentester), incorporate certifications or lab credentials, and provide step-by-step instructions for implementation.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Building the Portfolio

#### 1. Set Up the GitHub Repository
**Objective**: Create a clean, professional GitHub repository to host all projects and make it easy for recruiters to navigate.

**Steps**:
1. **Create the Repository**:
   - Log in to GitHub and click “New Repository.”
   - Name it `Cybersecurity-Portfolio`.
   - Set it to **Public** (recruiters need access).
   - Initialize with a README.md file.
   - Add a `.gitignore` file (use the Python template to exclude virtual environments or sensitive files like API keys).

2. **Organize Folder Structure**:
   - Create folders for each project:
     ```
     Cybersecurity-Portfolio/
     ├── README.md
     ├── Network-Traffic-Analysis/
     ├── Vulnerability-Assessment/
     ├── Incident-Response-Simulation/
     ├── System-Hardening/
     └── assets/ (for screenshots, diagrams, etc.)
     ```
   - Each project folder will contain:
     - A `README.md` with project-specific documentation.
     - Scripts (e.g., `.py`, `.sh`).
     - Reports (e.g., `.pdf` or `.md`).
     - Supporting files (e.g., sample PCAPs, logs).

3. **Write the Main README.md**:
   - Include the following sections:
     - **Introduction**: Briefly introduce yourself and the portfolio’s purpose (e.g., “This portfolio showcases my hands-on cybersecurity skills as an aspiring SOC analyst, with projects in network security, vulnerability management, and incident response.”).
     - **Projects**: List each project with a one-sentence description and a link to its folder.
     - **Certifications and Labs**: Mention credentials (e.g., “Completed CompTIA Security+ and TryHackMe’s SOC Analyst Path”).
     - **How to View**: Instructions for recruiters (e.g., “Navigate to each project folder for detailed READMEs, scripts, and reports. Screenshots and deliverables are in the assets folder.”).
     - **Contact**: Include your LinkedIn or email (e.g., “Connect with me on LinkedIn: [Your Profile URL]”).
   - Example README.md:
     ```markdown

   - Install Python and `pyshark` for scripting (`pip install pyshark`).

2. **Analyze the PCAP**:
   - Open the PCAP in a Wireshark.
   - Apply filters (e.g., `http.request` to find suspicious HTTP traffic or `dns` for unusual queries).
   - Identify malicious activity (e.g., C2 communication to a known malicious IP).
   - Export IOCs (e.g., IPs, domains) using Wireshark’s “Export Objects” or manual extraction.

3. **Write a Python Script**:
   - Create a script to automate IOC extraction (e.g., extract source/destination IPs).
   - Example:
     ```python
     import pyshark
     import csv

     pcap_file = 'sample.pcap'
     cap = = pyshark.File(pyshark.FileCapture(pcap_file)

     iocs = []     iocs = []
     for pkt in in_cap:
         if 'IP' in pkt:
             iocs.append((pkt.ip.src, pkt.ip.src, pkt.dst))
     unique_iocs = set(iocs)

     with open('iocs.csv', 'w', newline='') as a csvfile:
         writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
         writer.writerow(['Source_IP', 'Destination_IP'])
         for src, dst in unique_iocs:
             writer.writerow([src, dst])

     print("IOCs exported to iocs.csv")
     ```
   - Save as `extract_iocs.py`.

     - Recommendations: Block IOCs in firewall, monitor for similar traffic.
   - Include screenshots (e.g., Wireshark filter results, packet details).
   - Save as `network_analysis_report.pdf`.

5. **Create Project README**:
   - Sections:
     - **Summary**: “Analyzed a PCAP file to detect C2 communication using Wireshark and automated IOC extraction with Python.”
